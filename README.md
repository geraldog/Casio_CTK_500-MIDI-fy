# First try with Female Jumper Cables and a soldered pin-header

Raphaela Elpidio from Circuit Bending Brazil restored the CTK-500 and soldered a pin header to connect Female Jumper Cables

# Final work with bare-wire Jumper Cables soldered to Keyboard Flat Connector

Later on I asked my friend Adriano Amaral from ADR Eletronics to solder the bare-wire jumper cables directly to the Keyboard Flat Connector due to persistent bad contact

# Closer look at the Soldered Connector with Jumper Cables exiting drilled hole

Raphaela Elpidio from Circuit Bending Brazil also drilled a hole to the back of the Keyboard Top-Cover allowing free flow of Jumper Cables
